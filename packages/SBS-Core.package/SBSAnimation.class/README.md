A SBSAnimation is a meta class to provide the functionality for visual animations like fading or swiping performed by a specific morph. This class is only for inheritence, for the real animations look at SBSFadeAnimation and SBSSwipeAnimation. To perform an animation, choose an animation class like the two mentioned above and hand over a morph to the method "startAnimation:", that's it.
